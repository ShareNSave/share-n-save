To v2.5:
Make a complete backup (including database), delete /n2, /edit and /bin, drop upgrade files and recompile your solution.
Make sure checkInstallationStatus and allowInstallation are not false and there is an admin superuser in web.config.
Browse to the site, /N2/Installation/Upgrade and follow the upgrade instructions.

Breaking changes:
* The new UI might break some custom editors
* CKEditor replaces TinyMCE
* Nuget packages have changed and additional packages may be required to have previous functionality
* Lucene Search classes have moved to N2.Search.Lucene


To v2.4:
Make a complete backup (including database), delete /n2, /edit and /bin, drop upgrade files and recompile your solution.
Make sure checkInstallationStatus and allowInstallation are not false and there is an admin superuser in web.config.
Browse to the site, follow the upgrade instructions, including upgrade versions on separate page.

Breaking changes:
* Versions are stored differently and old versions are migrated. During this process part versions are lost.
* .NET >= 4.0 is now required
* NHibernate.Caches.SysCache2 is now integrated in N2.dll and dll and config should be removed


To v2.2 & v2.3:
Smooth sailing?


To v2.1:
Make a complete backup (including database), delete /n2, /edit and /bin, drop upgrade files and recompile your solution.

Breaking changes:
* LINQ doesn't currently work (as well as before)
* Shared[Parts|Pages] -> Shared/[Part|Page]Templates (changes convention)
* SMTP settings are no longer configured on the root page, use the standard .NET configuration instead, e.g.:
	<system.net>
	   <mailSettings>
		  <smtp from="someaddress@somehost.com">
			 <network host="mail.somehost.com" password="xxxxxx" port="25" userName="someaddress@somehost.com"/>
		  </smtp>
	   </mailSettings>
	</system.net>


To v2.0:
Make a complete backup (including database), delete /edit and /bin, drop upgrade files and recompile your solution.

Breaking changes:
- .NET 3.5 (or greater) is now required
- N2.Web.HtmlHelper is now deprecated and renamed to FormsHelper (to avoid conflicts with MVC)
- Adapters are not decorated with [Adapts] attribute rather than [Controls] and are not shared between instances
- Management interface is moved from /edit to /n2/content
- N2.Edit has been renamed to N2.Management
- Action<T> and Function<T> have been replaced with their equivalent in .NET 3.5
- Some namespaces have changed (e.g. Castle, Installation)
- The Alpha MVC templates have undergone a lot of changes (see http://n2cms.codeplex.com/Thread/View.aspx?ThreadId=208270)


To v1.5:
Upgrade hints:
- PageDefinition & PartDefinition are now recommended for defining pages and parts
- [Page/PartDefinition("The Title", TemplateUrl = "/path/to/the/template.as?x")] is preferred for referincing the template

Possibly breaking changes:
- Overriding ContentItem.IconUrl now only works in the tree. Use [PageDefinition("the title", IconUrl = "/path/to/the/icon.gif")] or [PartDefinition...] to change the new item screen.
- The user "admin" may have less permissions than before in some cases. Please create a membership user with roles instead.
- [ReplacesParentDefinition] now defaults to remove the parent definition and assume it's discriminator (use parameters to maintain old behaviour where the parent was just disabled)


To v1.4.5:
Instructions:
- Delete /App_Browsers/MaintainPostbackUrl.browser
- Add to web.config in /configuration/system.web/pages:
			<tagMapping>
				<!-- This maintains the friendly urls during postbacks -->
				<add tagType="System.Web.UI.HtmlControls.HtmlForm"  mappedTagType="N2.Web.UI.WebControls.RawUrlForm"/>
			</tagMapping>

Breaking changes:
- ContentItem.AddTo(Control) is removed, implement N2.Web.Parts.
- Zone.AddedItemTemplate and Zone.GettingItemTemplate are now frowned upon, they still work but disable the parts adapter


To v1.4.4:
Breaking changes:
- GetChild is no longer used to find items and cannot be used to modify the current item: Use FindPath instead
- MVC content items now requires [RouteActionResolver] to handle actions: add [RouteActionResolver] to your base class
- Control panel no longer expose buttons for external modification: remove stuff like <n2:ControlPanel SaveButton-Visible="false"
- Service editable can no longer be used


To v1.4.3:
- Major rearrangements of the templates project has been done running 
  these commands from the wwwroot directory should clear things up:

mkdir bak
move App_GlobalResources/* bak
move bin/N2.Templates.UI.dll bak
move advertisement bak
move calendar bak
move Faq bak
move form bak
move ImageGallery bak
move Img bak
move Js bak
move Layouts bak
move News bak
move Parts bak
move poll bak
move rss bak
move scrum bak
move Search bak
move Secured bak
move TabPanel bak
move UI bak
move Wiki bak
move Image.ashx bak


To v1.4.2:
- Recompile


To v1.4.1:

		- remove <section name="globalization"

		- move <n2><globalizatoin... to <n2><engine><globalization...
		- move <n2><installer... to <n2><edit><installer...
	- in <httpModules>

	- N2.Web.UI.UserControl<T> -> ContentUserControl<T>
